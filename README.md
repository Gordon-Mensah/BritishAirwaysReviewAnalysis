# British Airways Review Analysis

### Project Overview
This project analyzes customer reviews for British Airways, focusing on sentiment and topics within reviews. Using Python, web scraping, and natural language processing (NLP), the project extracts insights from Skytrax reviews to evaluate customer satisfaction and identify common areas of feedback, such as service quality, food, and refund experiences.

Additionally, a **Customer Booking Prediction Model** was developed as part of the analysis, aiming to forecast booking completion based on various customer-related features. This predictive model can be used to help airlines target specific customer segments more effectively.

### Project Objectives
- Scrape British Airways customer reviews from Skytrax.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the review data.
- Conduct sentiment analysis to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Apply topic modeling to identify frequently discussed themes.
- Develop a predictive model for customer booking completion.
- Visualize findings and present insights.

### Files in the Repository
- **analysis_notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with all data analysis, including web scraping, sentiment analysis, and visualizations.
- **BA_reviews.csv**: Dataset with scraped reviews (if permitted to share).
- **Customer Booking Prediction Model.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for the predictive model, including data preparation, training, and evaluation.
- **Customer Booking Prediction Model Summary.pptx**: PowerPoint slide summarizing key insights and model performance for stakeholders.
- **presentation.pptx**: PowerPoint slide summarizing key insights from the review analysis for stakeholders.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Main language for data analysis and modeling.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping Skytrax reviews.
- **pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **TextBlob**: For sentiment analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: For CountVectorizer, topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and predictive modeling.
- **matplotlib, seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **wordcloud**: To visualize frequently used words in reviews.

### Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Scrape customer reviews from Skytrax using BeautifulSoup.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean text data and extract relevant fields (review text, rating, recommendation).
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Categorize each review based on sentiment polarity (positive, neutral, or negative).
4. **Topic Modeling**: Use LDA to identify main topics within negative reviews, such as food quality, refund issues, and overall service.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Build a Random Forest model to predict booking completion, analyzing feature importance for actionable insights.
6. **Visualization**: Generate word clouds, bar charts, and pie charts to illustrate sentiment distribution, topic frequency, and model feature importance.
7. **Presentation**: Summarize findings in PowerPoint slides for stakeholder presentations.

### How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BritishAirwaysReviewAnalysis.git
   cd BritishAirwaysReviewAnalysis
   ```

2. **Install required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: You might need to create this `requirements.txt` file if it doesn't exist. To generate it, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.*

3. **Run the analysis and prediction notebooks**:
   - Open `analysis_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and run each cell to reproduce the analysis.
   - Open `Customer Booking Prediction Model.ipynb` to run the booking prediction analysis.

### Key Findings
- **Sentiment Distribution**: A high percentage of reviews are negative, indicating prevalent customer dissatisfaction.
- **Common Issues**: Topics like "food quality," "refunds," and "service delays" are common in negative reviews.
- **Predictive Model Insights**: Key features like purchase lead time, length of stay, and customer preferences significantly influence booking completion.
- **Business Recommendations**: British Airways could improve customer experience by addressing food quality, better handling refund requests, and focusing marketing on routes with high booking completion rates.

### Future Work
- **Automate data scraping** for real-time monitoring of reviews.
- **Expand analysis** to cover additional review platforms.
- **Enhance prediction accuracy**: Experiment with other machine learning models, such as gradient boosting and BERT for sentiment analysis.
